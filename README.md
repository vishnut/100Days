# HackerRank

I am starting the #100DaysofAlgorithm Challenge today. Apart from my regular projects and coursework, I will be setting aside some time to complete a few HackerRank problems everyday. This started in the Hackathon Hackers Facebook community and I am proud to start my own 100 days today. Wish me luck!

Day 1: Completed Warmup Problems

Day 2: Started on CTCI Problems - not as much today as I was working on another personal project :)

Day 3: A few more from CTCI

Day 4: Project Euler #14 (pushed to a private repo), more from CTCI including DP and graph problems

Day 5: A few from CTCI - cycles, queues, anagrams

Day 6: CTCI - Bubble and Prime

Day 7: CTCI - Lonely Island 

Day 8: Fibonacci and Davis' Staircase from CTCI

Day 9: Ice Cream Parlor from CTCI, counting inversions
